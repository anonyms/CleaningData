CleaningData
============

Please load the "run_analysis.R" file, and then run the function "run_analysis()". This will return the tidy data set, as described in the assignment. 

Please note that your working directory should be set to contain the 'UCI HAR DATASET' unzipped folder.

The script only takes into account variables specified with mean() or std(), as this was specified in the Assignment (meanFreq() and variables using a mean parameter are not taken into account)

The codebook simply denotes the variables present in the tidy data set.
